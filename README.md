## Using Plotly to design a data dashboard 
Illustration of a dataset of more than 150 patients and their belly button bacteria. The dataset includes demographic data on the patient, as well as the ID numbers of the bacteria found in their belly button, the name of the bacteria, the amount of the individual bacteria IDs found, and the number of times the patient washes their belly button per week. Site users can select individual patient ID numbers to display three dashboards illustrating the data.
